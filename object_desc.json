    "description": "#first encounter #first encounter.\n This is the first encounter in the patient's timeline. It is an Outpatient Visit recorded on March 5, 2024, with Dr. P. Stevens (General Practice). The patient, Sarah Miller (43, Female), presented with a chief complaint of increased fatigue over the past 4-5 months. The assessment revealed suboptimal control of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (HbA1c 58 mmol/mol) and Hypertension, alongside Chronic Fatigue Syndrome possibly related to Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). Physical exam noted a BMI of 32.0 (Class I obesity), BP 146/92 mmHg, and mild effusion in the right wrist due to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The plan involved ordering complete LFTs and HbA1c, with a follow-up scheduled in 4 weeks to evaluate eligibility for Methotrexate (MTX) therapy."

    "description": "This is the second encounter, an Outpatient visit occurring on April 1, 2024, with Dr. P. Stevens. The visit focused on reviewing abnormal liver function tests and planning Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment. The assessment highlighted an elevated ALT of 78 U/L, raising concerns for hepatocellular inflammation potentially related to MASLD. Consequently, Methotrexate initiation was deferred. The patient reported slight weight loss (0.5–1 kg) and was educated on the risks of liver injury. Vitals showed BP 142/90 mmHg and BMI 31.8. The plan included a comprehensive liver panel (HBsAg, HCV, ANA, Ferritin, etc.) and instructions to return in 4 weeks to review results."

    "description": "This is the third encounter, an Outpatient Follow-up on May 6, 2024, with Dr. P. Stevens. The purpose was to review the normalization of LFTs and reconsider Methotrexate initiation. The assessment showed LFTs had normalized (ALT 35 U/L) following ~1.5 kg weight loss and lifestyle changes; the hepatitis workup was negative. The impression was a transient elevation likely related to MASLD, and the patient was cleared for Methotrexate. Vitals included BP 140/88 mmHg and BMI 31.2. The plan instructed the patient to begin Methotrexate (7.5mg weekly) and Folic acid (5mg weekly) starting June 3, 2024, with a strict schedule for LFT and FBC monitoring every 6 weeks.\n\nCase :\n8. Has a non-invasive liver screen been performed? If so, what is the likelihood of\nother liver diseases?\n\nYes — a non-invasive liver screen has been performed, and the results strongly suggest that the likelihood of other chronic liver diseases is low. In Encounter 3, she underwent a full viral hepatitis screen (HBsAg, HBcAb, HCV Ab), autoimmune panel (ANA, ASMA, LKM-1, IgG), and metabolic testing (Ferritin, TIBC), all of which were negative or normal, effectively ruling out chronic viral, autoimmune, and metabolic liver disease. Her Fib-4 score was 0.9, which falls into the low-risk category (<1.3) for significant fibrosis or cirrhosis, further reducing suspicion of alternative chronic pathology.\n\nIn addition, the USG (ultrasound) abdomen performed during her acute presentation showed coarse, steatotic liver parenchyma with hepatomegaly, consistent with MASLD/MASH, but critically no bile duct dilatation, no ascites, no portal hypertension, no nodularity, and patent portal/hepatic veins — all of which argue against other structural liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, infiltrative disorders, or obstructive causes. Taken together, both the screening panels, Fib-4 score, and imaging findings indicate that the likelihood of other liver diseases is very low, and her course is most consistent with MASLD with superimposed Methotrexate-induced DILI rather than another chronic liver disease. #non-invasive-liver-screen #non-invasive-liver-screen.\n\n12. What other liver-related investigations are outstanding?\nSeveral liver-related investigations are still outstanding in Sarah Miller’s management plan. The most important pending test is a Fibroscan, scheduled for three months after her acute DILI episode, to reassess liver stiffness and evaluate for any fibrosis progression, as documented in Encounter 7. She also requires continued daily INR monitoring until her ALT falls below 150 U/L, along with repeat LFTs to confirm recovery trends. Additionally, tasks remain active for arranging her discharge medications (including UDCA) and coordinating the rheumatology referral for a safe, non-hepatotoxic DMARD alternative. Together, these pending steps ensure full evaluation of her hepatic recovery and prevention of further liver injury. #outstanding #investigations."

    "description" : "'Case :\n7. From her other blood results, is there any evidence of liver cirrhosis?\nThere is no evidence to suggest established liver cirrhosis. Her synthetic liver function remains intact throughout — INR stays normal (1.0–1.1), and platelet counts are normal (250×10⁹/L), which strongly argues against portal hypertension or decompensated cirrhosis. The Fib-4 score of 0.9 in Encounter 3 places her firmly in the low-risk category for significant fibrosis or cirrhosis, and although a later Fib-4 rises to 1.8, this is during acute Methotrexate-induced liver injury and does not reflect chronic fibrosis. Additionally, ultrasound imaging shows steatotic/MASH changes without nodularity, ascites, or portal vein abnormalities, further excluding cirrhosis.\n\nWhile she does experience severe acute DILI with marked transaminitis and cholestasis later in her course, these represent acute hepatocellular injury, not chronic cirrhotic dysfunction. Overall, the combination of normal INR, normal platelets, low pre-injury Fib-4, and imaging without cirrhotic features provides strong, consistent evidence that she does not have cirrhosis.\n'"

    "description" : "Case :\n10. What is the treatment recommendation for the likely diagnosis?\nThe recommended treatment is immediate and permanent cessation of Methotrexate, which is identified as the definitive cause of her acute hepatocellular injury. This step was implemented urgently in Encounter 6 following worsening transaminitis and new-onset jaundice (ALT 490 U/L, bilirubin 110 μmol/L). She was admitted for hospital-based management, including intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) following the 3-bag protocol, consistent with guidelines for severe hepatocellular DILI even when unrelated to paracetamol. Supportive care included close monitoring of INR, neurological status, and daily LFTs. The ultrasound confirmed no obstruction, supporting the DILI diagnosis.\n\nLong-term recommendations outlined in Encounter 7 include permanent Methotrexate contraindication, initiation of Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) for cholestasis, and arranging follow-up investigations such as Fibroscan in three months to assess for fibrosis progression. Rheumatology review is required to initiate a non-hepatotoxic alternative DMARD (e.g., Hydroxychloroquine or a biologic). Overall, the treatment approach focuses on removing the offending agent, treating acute hepatocellular injury, managing cholestatic symptoms, and avoiding future hepatotoxic medications.#treatment #recommendation \n\n9. Calculate the probability of the most likely cause and rank the most likely differentials.\nBased on the full clinical picture, the most likely cause of Sarah Miller’s acute liver injury is Methotrexate-induced Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI), with an estimated probability of 85–90%. This probability is strongly supported by the clear temporal relationship between MTX initiation and the rapid rise in ALT from 35 U/L to 185 U/L, followed by a peak of 490 U/L with severe jaundice. Additional supportive findings include the presence of metabolic risk factors (MASLD/MASH, obesity, diabetes), a negative viral, autoimmune, and metabolic screen, and ultrasound findings that exclude obstruction.The remaining differentials are significantly less likely. A flare of underlying MASLD/MASH is a secondary consideration (~10%) but does not typically produce the extreme hepatocellular injury seen here. Other possibilities—such as NSAID-related hepatotoxicity, autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis, or mechanical biliary obstruction—carry very low probabilities (<3% combined) due to inconsistent clinical patterns, negative serology, normal IgG and autoimmune markers, and imaging that shows no ductal dilation or obstructive pathology. #probability #differential-diagnosis."

    "description" : "'Case :\n11. What other treatment options are available to Sarah Miller for her rheumatoid\narthritis, which does not affect the liver?\n\nGiven Sarah Miller’s severe Methotrexate-induced DILI, she now requires rheumatoid arthritis treatments that do not pose liver toxicity risks. The safest non-hepatotoxic options include Hydroxychloroquine, which has minimal hepatic metabolism and is considered one of the safest DMARDs for patients with liver impairment, and Sulfasalazine, which carries a very low risk of hepatotoxicity and is commonly used when Methotrexate is contraindicated. In more active disease, biologic agents such as TNF-α inhibitors (e.g., Etanercept, Adalimumab) or IL-6 inhibitors (e.g., Tocilizumab) are viable because they bypass hepatic metabolism and do not typically worsen underlying liver disease.\n\nShort-term low-dose corticosteroids may also be used as bridging therapy to control symptoms while transitioning to a safer long-term agent. These recommendations are consistent with the hepatology team’s plan in Encounter 7, where Methotrexate was permanently contraindicated and a referral was made to select a non-hepatotoxic DMARD alternative\n'"

    "description" : "A review of Sarah Miller’s medication history shows one clear hepatotoxic agent capable of causing her pattern of liver injury: Methotrexate (MTX). Prior to MTX initiation, her routine medications included Metformin, Ramipril, and Folic Acid. The timeline strongly supports MTX as the causative agent: her ALT was normal (35 U/L) before starting MTX, then rose to 185 U/L six weeks later, and subsequently peaked at 490 U/L with bilirubin at 110–190 μmol/L. This progression, combined with the absence of viral, autoimmune, or metabolic liver disease, and confirmed by a RUCAM score of 9/10 during hepatology review, indicates Methotrexate as the definitive cause. No other medication in her regimen shows a plausible pattern or timing consistent with the severity and type of liver injury observed."
