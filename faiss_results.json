        "description": "'Case :\n11. What other treatment options are available to Sarah Miller for her rheumatoid\narthritis, which does not affect the liver?\n\nGiven Sarah Miller’s severe Methotrexate-induced DILI, she now requires rheumatoid arthritis treatments that do not pose liver toxicity risks. The safest non-hepatotoxic options include Hydroxychloroquine, which has minimal hepatic metabolism and is considered one of the safest DMARDs for patients with liver impairment, and Sulfasalazine, which carries a very low risk of hepatotoxicity and is commonly used when Methotrexate is contraindicated. In more active disease, biologic agents such as TNF-α inhibitors (e.g., Etanercept, Adalimumab) or IL-6 inhibitors (e.g., Tocilizumab) are viable because they bypass hepatic metabolism and do not typically worsen underlying liver disease.\n\nShort-term low-dose corticosteroids may also be used as bridging therapy to control symptoms while transitioning to a safer long-term agent. These recommendations are consistent with the hepatology team’s plan in Encounter 7, where Methotrexate was permanently contraindicated and a referral was made to select a non-hepatotoxic DMARD alternative\n'",

While RA symptoms improved, diabetes control deteriorated (HbA1c 60 mmol/mol). Vitals showed BP 144/92 mmHg. The plan involved repeating LFTs in four weeks, advising vigilance for jaundice, and adjusting the medication regimen to Methotrexate 5mg weekly while recommending a Hepatology consultation.

        "description": "This is the third encounter, an Outpatient Follow-up on May 6, 2024, with Dr. P. Stevens. The purpose was to review the normalization of LFTs and reconsider Methotrexate initiation. The assessment showed LFTs had normalized (ALT 35 U/L) following ~1.5 kg weight loss and lifestyle changes; the hepatitis workup was negative. The impression was a transient elevation likely related to MASLD, and the patient was cleared for Methotrexate. Vitals included BP 140/88 mmHg and BMI 31.2. The plan instructed the patient to begin Methotrexate (7.5mg weekly) and Folic acid (5mg weekly) starting June 3, 2024, with a strict schedule for LFT and FBC monitoring every 6 weeks.\n\nCase :\n8. Has a non-invasive liver screen been performed? If so, what is the likelihood of\nother liver diseases?\n\nYes — a non-invasive liver screen has been performed, and the results strongly suggest that the likelihood of other chronic liver diseases is low. In Encounter 3, she underwent a full viral hepatitis screen (HBsAg, HBcAb, HCV Ab), autoimmune panel (ANA, ASMA, LKM-1, IgG), and metabolic testing (Ferritin, TIBC), all of which were negative or normal, effectively ruling out chronic viral, autoimmune, and metabolic liver disease. Her Fib-4 score was 0.9, which falls into the low-risk category (<1.3) for significant fibrosis or cirrhosis, further reducing suspicion of alternative chronic pathology.\n\nIn addition, the USG (ultrasound) abdomen performed during her acute presentation showed coarse, steatotic liver parenchyma with hepatomegaly, consistent with MASLD/MASH, but critically no bile duct dilatation, no ascites, no portal hypertension, no nodularity, and patent portal/hepatic veins — all of which argue against other structural liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, infiltrative disorders, or obstructive causes. Taken together, both the screening panels, Fib-4 score, and imaging findings indicate that the likelihood of other liver diseases is very low, and her course is most consistent with MASLD with superimposed Methotrexate-induced DILI rather than another chronic liver disease. #non-invasive-liver-screen #non-invasive-liver-screen.\n\n12. What other liver-related investigations are outstanding?\nSeveral liver-related investigations are still outstanding in Sarah Miller’s management plan. The most important pending test is a Fibroscan, scheduled for three months after her acute DILI episode, to reassess liver stiffness and evaluate for any fibrosis progression, as documented in Encounter 7. She also requires continued daily INR monitoring until her ALT falls below 150 U/L, along with repeat LFTs to confirm recovery trends. Additionally, tasks remain active for arranging her discharge medications (including UDCA) and coordinating the rheumatology referral for a safe, non-hepatotoxic DMARD alternative. Together, these pending steps ensure full evaluation of her hepatic recovery and prevention of further liver injury. #outstanding #investigations.",

Mild elevations in March normalized by May, followed by a severe, progressive spike in ALT and AST starting in July and peaking in August.\n\nBilirubin: Remained normal until a sharp increase in August, indicating late-stage acute injury.\n\nSynthetic Function: INR remained stable and within reference range (0.8–1.2) throughout the period.\n\nDiabetes: HbA1c levels remained consistently above the reference range, indicating suboptimal glycemic control.\n\nClinical Q&A:\n\nQ: Which liver function tests are elevated?\n\nA: ALT, AST, and Total Bilirubin are significantly elevated.\n\nALT peaked at 490 U/L (Ref: 0-40).\n\nAST peaked at 350 U/L (Ref: 0-35).\n\nTotal Bilirubin peaked at 190 µmol/L (Ref: 0-21).\n\nNote: INR remained normal (1.1), indicating preserved clotting function.\n\nQ: When did these become abnormal?\n\nA: While there was a mild, transient elevation in March (ALT 78), the tests normalized in May. The significant abnormality began on July 15, 2024, when ALT spiked to 185 U/L and AST to 130 U/L. This worsened drastically by August 12, 2024, when Bilirubin also spiked to 110 µmol/L.\n\nQ: How has her diabetes control been?\n\nA: Her diabetes control has been suboptimal and slightly worsening.\n\nHbA1c values were consistently elevated above the reference maximum of 48 mmol/mol.\n\nValues recorded were: 58 mmol/mol (March), 56 mmol/mol (May), and 60 mmol/mol (July).\n'",
