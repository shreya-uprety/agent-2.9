        "causality": "The patient developed acute jaundice, confusion, and hepatic tenderness shortly after initiating TMP-SMX, a timeline strongly suggestive of idiosyncratic hepatocellular DILI. Mechanistically, TMP-SMX can potentiate methotrexate toxicity by increasing free methotrexate levels and impairing folate metabolism. The clinical pattern is hepatocellular, and the presence of encephalopathy with presumed INR >1.5 and elevated bilirubin meets criteria for acute liver failure. RUCAM analysis suggests TMP-SMX as the primary culprit with methotrexate as a significant co-factor.",
