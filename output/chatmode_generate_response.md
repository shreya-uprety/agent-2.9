### Sarah Miller – Radiology Diagnostic Summary (CT/MRI)

**Patient:** Sarah Miller (MRN: SM43850603)  
**Date Range Reviewed:** 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31  
**Modalities:** CT, MRI, Ultrasound  
**Status:** Final  

#### Radiology Reports Retrieved

| Date       | Modality | Body Site | Report ID | Key Findings Summary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|------------------------|
| 2024-08-12 | Ultrasound Abdomen | Abdomen | USG-240812-001 | No sonographic evidence of biliary obstruction; CBD normal at 5.1 mm. Liver shows mild steatosis compatible with MASLD. No focal hepatic lesions or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Normal portal vein flow. No splenomegaly. |

#### Impression
Imaging findings on Ultrasound Abdomen are consistent with mild steatosis, supporting the diagnosis of Metabolic Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). Crucially, there is no evidence of biliary obstruction or ductal dilation, which helps to rule out obstructive causes for the patient's acute presentation of jaundice and elevated liver enzymes. The findings align with a hepatocellular process, such as Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI), as the primary driver of the acute liver dysfunction.

#### Audit & Review
- Reviewed patient context, including primary diagnosis of Severe Drug-Induced Liver Injury (Methotrexate-related) and existing comorbidities such as MASLD.
- Executed search for radiology diagnostic reports (CT, MRI, Ultrasound) for Sarah Miller within the specified date range.
- One relevant Ultrasound Abdomen report was retrieved. No CT or MRI reports for the abdomen/liver were identified within the provided patient data for the specified timeframe.
- Data source: Simulated retrieval based on patient encounter data and radiology report structure.
- Reviewed by Clinical Task Orchestrator.
