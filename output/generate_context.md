| 2016-02-20 | General Practice | Stable RA on MTX | Methotrexate 10mg weekly, Folic Acid 5mg weekly | Good RA control on MTX; no MTX side effects |
| 2018-09-05 | General Practice | New essential hypertension; RA stable; plan MTX dose increase | Methotrexate 20mg weekly, Folic Acid 5mg weekly, Lisinopril 10mg daily | MTX increased to 20mg due to mild flares |
| 2021-03-15 | General Practice | Stable RA; controlled HTN; mild CKD (stable) | Methotrexate 20mg weekly, Folic Acid 5mg weekly, Lisinopril 10mg daily | RA controlled on MTX 20 mg; BP controlled |
| 2025-06-15 | General Practice | Acute bacterial sinusitis; RA/HTN/CKD stable | Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 800/160mg BID | Started TMP-SMX for sinusitis |
| 2025-06-21 | Emergency Medicine | Acute liver injury likely DILI and/or severe methotrexate toxicity | — | Severe fatigue, jaundice, epigastric pain, confusion |

## Medication History (Relevant to Liver)
- Methotrexate – 10mg weekly, PO, indication: RA, start: 2015-08-10, end: 2018-09-05
- Methotrexate – 20mg weekly, PO, indication: RA, start: 2018-09-05
- Folic Acid – 5mg weekly, PO, indication: MTX supplementation, start: 2015-08-10
- Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole – 800/160mg BID, PO, indication: Acute bacterial sinusitis, start: 2025-06-15, end: 2025-06-25
- Lisinopril – 10 mg daily, PO, indication: Hypertension, start: 2018-09-05

## Recent Clinical Events
- June 15, 2025: Presented to GP with acute bacterial sinusitis and was prescribed Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 800/160mg BID for 10 days.
- June 21, 2025: Presented to the Emergency Department with severe fatigue, jaundice, epigastric pain, and confusion. Diagnosed with acute liver injury likely DILI and/or severe methotrexate toxicity.
- Investigations included LFTs (ALT 1650 U/L, AST 2100 U/L, Total Bilirubin 12.5 mg/dL, Alk Phos 350 U/L), INR 1, and suspected hepatic encephalopathy (asterixis, disorientation).

## Key Considerations for EASL Interpretation
- Temporal relationship: Liver injury occurred shortly after initiating TMP-SMX in a patient on chronic MTX.
- Risk factors: Age, female sex, RA, CKD, chronic MTX use, and addition of TMP-SMX.
- The clinical picture is concerning for acute liver failure.
- Differential diagnosis included severe methotrexate toxicity, TMP-SMX-induced DILI, and acute viral hepatitis.
