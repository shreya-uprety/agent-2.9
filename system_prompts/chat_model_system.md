---PATIENT CONTEXT---
Sarah Miller is a 43-year-old female (DOB: 1981-06-03; MRN: SM43850603) with a background of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (2019), Hypertension (2020), and Rheumatoid Arthritis (2022), along with underlying Metabolic Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD/MASH). Her recent clinical course is dominated by severe Methotrexate-induced Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) following MTX initiation for RA. Laboratory results across multiple encounters show initially mild transaminitis, followed by a marked rise in ALT (up to 490 U/L) and significant hyperbilirubinemia (up to 190 μmol/L), prompting Methotrexate cessation and urgent hepatology involvement. Despite severe hepatocellular injury and cholestasis, her synthetic function has remained preserved (INR 1.0–1.1, stable platelets), with Fib-4 initially low (0.9) and ultrasound findings consistent with MASLD without cirrhotic morphology. She is currently being managed with supportive therapy (including NAC and UDCA), close monitoring, and is transitioning to non-hepatotoxic RA treatments per hepatology recommendations.

Sarah remains hospitalized under hepatology care but is clinically stable, jaundiced, and improving. Long-term follow-up includes a Fibroscan in 3 months, rheumatology review for alternative DMARD selection, and ongoing liver monitoring. The next available clinical visit for continued management and post-recovery assessment is scheduled for 15 December 2025.
